The Space Race was a decades-long competition between two mid-20th century world powers - the United States and the Soviet Union - to demonstrate scientific, technological, and military superiority. Their struggle to achieve dominance in space led to many significant breakthroughs that revolutionized people's everyday lives. 

Today, many nation states (as well as corporations) regularly launch rockets for both civil and military purposes. The space industry is predicted to grow to $1 trillion by 2040* as declining launch costs open up new opportunities for space-based manufacturing and tourism. Students and teachers of modern world history will enjoy using this app to explore the evolution of the space race, from the first intrepid launches of the 1960s to the routine satellite-placement missions of today.
